# Delete

## Overview

The `delete` script is used to remove entries from a local JSON database. It reads a schema definition from `dbdata.json`, validates the provided data against the schema, and then removes the matching entry from the corresponding JSON file in the `db` directory.It takes the first field and compares it and the first entry that matches the description of the value of that field is remove.

## Usage

```js
const { deleteEntry } = require('../helpers/delete');

// Delete a user with ID '3'
deleteEntry('User', { id: '3' });

// Delete a post with ID '3'
deleteEntry('Post', { id: '3' });
