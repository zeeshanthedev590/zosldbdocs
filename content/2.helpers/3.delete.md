# Delete

## Overview

The `delete` script is used to remove entries from a local JSON database. It reads a schema definition from `dbdata.json`, validates the provided data against the schema, and then removes the matching entry from the corresponding JSON file in the `db` directory.It takes the value entered by you in the function and compares it to the value of the first field of all the entries , hence the only the first matching entry is removed.

## Usage

```js
const { deleteEntry } = require('../helpers/delete');

// Delete a user with ID '3'
deleteEntry('User', { id: '3' });

// Delete a post with ID '3'
deleteEntry('Post', { id: '3' });
